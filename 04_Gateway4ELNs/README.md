# Raspberry Pi as a Gateway

For this task, any RasPi hardware is suitable. No extra hardware or shield is used, but a USB-to-ethernet converter is required for the second network.

We have connected the Windows computer as a private network with this converter to get access to parts of the hard drive. Therefore, disk sharing on the Windows computer must be established before.
