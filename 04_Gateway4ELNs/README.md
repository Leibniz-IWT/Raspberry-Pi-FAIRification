# Raspberry Pi as a Gateway

For this task, any RasPi hardware is suitable. No extra hardware or shield is used, but a USB-to-ethernet converter is required for the second network, and a terminal switch with some cables to connect the RasPi with keyboard, mouse and monitor of the existing computer with an older and now unsupported operating systems, mostly Windows XP or 7.

We have connected the Windows computer as a private network with the USB converter to get access to parts of the hard drive. Therefore, disk sharing on the Windows computer must be established before.
