# CO<sub>2</sub> Measurement Device

We have used an Joy-It Explorer 700 shield and a CO2 sensor (MG 811). The Joy-It Explorer shield is a multifunctional board with AD-converter (8-bit resolution), 1-wire sensor interface, pressure sensor, real-time clock, buzzer, LEDs and with a small OLED display as well as a small joystick to interact with programs.

The MG 811 sensor comes with an interface to provide voltage supply from the Raspberry Pi and deliver an analog output which is connected to the analog input "AIN0" ^of the Explorer 700 shield.
